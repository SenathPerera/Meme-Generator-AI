**MemeForge-AI** is an open-source AI-powered meme generator designed to create, customize, and share memes easily. It combines natural language processing (NLP), caption generation, and user-friendly interfaces to provide a seamless meme creation experience.<br/>

At its core, the system is driven by four specialized agents, each responsible for a key step in the meme creation pipeline:

### 1. Meme Idea Agent
Understands the user prompt, extracts context, and generates witty and relevant meme captions.<br/>
Uses OpenAI and Grok APIs for caption generation.

### 2. Template Retrieval Agent
Fetches meme templates from multiple sources:
- Imgflip API
- Memegen API
- Reddit API<br/>

It builds a pool of template candidates, embeds both template names and the user prompt into vectors, and uses cosine similarity to select the top 6 most relevant templates.

### 3. Security Compliance Agent
Ensures the safety and appropriateness of generated captions and retrieved templates.<br/>
NSFW, offensive, or unsafe content is filtered out by default.<br/>
Users can optionally disable the safety filter, in which case the system bypasses security checks.<br/>

### 4. Meme Generator Agent
Combines the selected caption and meme template to produce the final AI-generated meme image.<br/>
This project demonstrates end-to-end integration of LLMs, information retrieval, API fusion, and content safety mechanisms, all wrapped into a smooth meme-generation experience.
